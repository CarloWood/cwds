# DEPENDENCIES
#

# We depend on these even when utils is not part of the project.

# Compile with -pthread.
find_package(Threads REQUIRED)

# debug_ostream_operators.h: #include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>
#                            #include <boost/weak_ptr.hpp>
# tracked.h:                 #include <boost/range/adaptor/reversed.hpp>
find_package(Boost REQUIRED)

# If utils is part of the project then we depend on it only if EnableDebugGlobal is ON.
# However, utils depends on cwds. To avoid a circular dependency we do never include
# the dependency on AICxx::utils. This is ok because utils is an OBJECT library and
# adding a dependency on it here would only cause its INTERFACE to be inherited,
# which happens to be Threads and Boost, which we depend on anyway, and the include
# directory of utils for sys.h and debug.h is the same, so we should get that too
# already (this means however that utils MUST be in project root, as does cwds).
